Project Overview

This project implements a real-time parking slot occupancy detection system using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. The system detects and classifies parking slots as Occupied or Available from images and video streams, and displays results through a web-based interface with live video and slot counting.

The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and includes comprehensive unit tests, mocked inference testing, and deployment-ready architecture.
